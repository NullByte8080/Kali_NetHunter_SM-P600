# Kali_NetHunter_SM-P600
This is a repository for storing all of the scripts, documentation, binaries, etc. required to setup a Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition (SM-P600) with Kali's NetHunter, as well as some other general tools for maximum usability. The ultimate goal is to create a tablet that retains day-to-day usability, while also being able to quickly and seamlessly be leverage for Penetration Testing / InfoSec Assessments.

Currently, I am just collecting all of the tools needed to make the build. Once there is a working setup, this readme will be updated to reflect that, with instructions for getting setup.

Feel free to reach out if you would like to contribute.

Thanks!
